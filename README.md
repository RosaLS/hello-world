Learning how to use Github

I'm new to Github. I'm motivated to learn how to code an app or whatever that evolves from here. I go with the flow; whatever my heart leads me I create. Hopefully I complete this practice and not give up in the middle. I just might surprise myself with the end result and become a pro.
